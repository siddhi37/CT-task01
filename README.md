   - Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
   - Mark tasks as completed.
   - Delete tasks from the list.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Clean design with easy-to-use controls.

3. **Persistence:**
   - Tasks should persist even if the user refreshes the page.
   - Use local storage or a backend server to store task data.

4. **Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.

5. **Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that tasks are not added with empty titles.

### Technologies:
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the user interface.
  
### Project Structure:

  - `list.html`: Main HTML file with the structure of the application.
  - `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
  
### Milestones:
1. **Setup and Basic UI:**
   - Set up the project structure.
   - Create the basic UI layout.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Implement functionality to add, mark, and delete tasks.

3. **Persistence:**
   - Store task data locally or on a server.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Make the application responsive.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Security:** Ensure that the application is secure, especially if handling user data.
- **Accessibility:** Make the application accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Localization:** Consider adding support for multiple languages.
- **Scalability:** If implementing a backend, design it to scale as the user base grows.
